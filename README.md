# Blackjack

This project is a python implementation of Blackjack using object-oriented programming to create buttons, cards, decks of cards, and the game itself. The game is played between the user and an automated dealer, and ends when the player busts, or when they stand and their hand is compared to the dealer's hand after their turn.
